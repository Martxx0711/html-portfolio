<h1>The Best Movie According to Feil</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
    <h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
        <p>First things first, it's very geeky. It's got kings and knights, crowns and swords, dragons and ghosts. Medieval drama is a genre we get precious little of on television (or in movies, for that matter), and Game of Thrones has nearly 10 hours of it. Plus, the series of books boasts fans who are as serious about the happenings in Westeros – where most of the book's action takes place – as any hardcore Trekkie or Star Wars geek is about those sagas.

    <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
        <p>The film's makers depicted some breathtaking views of Ladakh's rugged environment. These sequences were captured using a variety of camera angles, including high angle, crane, and parallax views. These bright images were cleverly employed to suggest that a pleasant and exciting event was on the way. I thought the video was highly informative in the manner it seeks to raise awareness and educate viewers about the rising danger of suicides in India's school system. The tone of the picture shifts quickly from joyful to sorrowful to funny, and so on. As a result, the picture became more exciting since I was continually on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what intriguing incident would unfold. I used to believe that all Bollywood films were low-budget and had bad performers, but I've since learned that some of their actors are very convincing, even by Hollywood standards! These acting talents have inspired me to watch more Bollywood films since they have shown me how exceptional they can be.</p>
    <h3>Friends</h3>
        <p>I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond.</p>
